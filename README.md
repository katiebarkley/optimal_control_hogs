This code belongs to the working paper "Evasive Invasive: A bioeconomic Model for Adaptive Wild Pigs".

The bioeconomic model is solved in the Mathematica code and the Matlab code. 
The Mathematica code provides better visualizations for the phase diagrams but Matlab can solve for the FTRR faster and thus both were used. 

There are different mathematica codes, one for a constant parameter and one which has a state equation for said paramter. The latter has not been solved yet.

The matlab codes must be used in tandem as one code has the functions.

The R code provides an algorithm for an Iterative Value Function and a Value Function graph. It also contains code to simulate optimal paths, but was not used for that in the paper.
